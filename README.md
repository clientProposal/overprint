__Objective__

The objective of this code is to create 2 alternating files demonstrating the difference between using or not using overprint mode. 

Please note that in order to see a visible difference, you should use a viewer capable of displaying overprint (Acrobat recommendable).

Even still, with Acrobat, you should switch on overprint:

Preferences -> Use overprint preview
